    "text": "I spent almost the whole day at the beach today, and I swear I could live there forever. The sun was warm but not too much, and the ocean breeze felt like a gentle reminder to slow down. There was this moment right before sunset when the sky turned a perfect mix of gold and pink. I had sand between my toes, salt on my skin, and a melting popsicle in my hand. Everything just felt light, carefree, and full of joy.",
